# Wireframe & Justification

This document should help you explain how your user interfaces are designed. You should have a wireframe to give a good overview and some screenshot with simple writeups to justify your designs.

## Justifications

### Justification 1(Result and Computation)

#### Good Points

1. We are allowed to choose a specific country and capital.
2. When you do a partial search, there are some choices which appear automatically.
3. We are able to select multiple locations, meaning compute for multiple inputs. 
4. There are different colors to show the availability of the parties, with green showing the most available and red being the least available.
5. They show the locations' local time which gives us a better idea on how to plan a meeting.

#### Bad Points
 
1. Too many computation inputs which can make the screen look very cramped, hard for the user to read.
2. The colors used(red,green,yellow) are not suitable for people who are colorblind.
3. The user cannot change the time intervals according to what they prefer to see/use.
4. The spread of the area of the 2 columns for Jacksonville(J) and Singapore (S) are uneven
with J taking up 2/3 of the column space while S taking up only 1/3 of the column space,
making it aesthetically hard to read the results which can be misleading.

### Justification 2(Showing Availability)

#### Good Points

1. The website shows times where my partner is free but I'm not free, when I am free but my partner isn't, when both of us are free and when both of us are not free which aids in planning for a meeting.
2. I don't have to click the box to view the availability/unavailability, I just need to hover my mouse over the box which is good as it reduces the effort of clicking the mouse multiple times. 
3. They have specific results for computations, dark green meaning both are free, light green meaning one is free and white means both are unavailable.
4. There are legend labels available, making it simple to understand. 
5. Search buttons are clearly present. 
#### Bad Points

1. The colors utilised(pinkish red and green) are not suitable for people who are colorblind which makes this website tough to use.
2. All the info is crammed into one column of timing rather than multiple columns to compare it side by side. This makes it visually unattractive to users. 
3. They have to hover over the minibox at a particular time just to see a fraction of the result out of the entire day's availability.
4. The rows and boxes are way too small, which makes it tough for the user to click, read and view the results.


### Justification 3

#### Good Points

1. We can change the time intervals and view the meeting times accordingly, this allows wider amount
of information of possibilities.
2. We can view the time in 24H format(and can change the time format (if we want to) as well).
3. It allows multiple inputs for computation, which can give a more advanced search.
4. Search buttons are present to compute results.
5. Clear labelling and navigation of search/show/submit button for request of information. 

#### Bad Points

1. You can only search for a day at a time and not a range of days which is not feasible as if we know the schedule in advance, we can be more prepared. All in all, this may prove to be slightly inflexible. 
2. It does not give the best timings for a meeting. It does not give you a summary pair up of a green to green row or yellow to green row or green to yellow row. 
3. The color of the day of time of morning legend and day of time of evening legend both are in a shade of yellow and not in different shades/colors which may be confusing for viewers who want to plan a meeting. 
4. The time intervals are only 1 hour and 2 hours. There is minimal flexibility of time intervals you want to view.
