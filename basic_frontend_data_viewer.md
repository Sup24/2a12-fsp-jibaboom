# Wireframe & Justification

This document should help you explain how your user interfaces are designed. You should have a wireframe to give a good overview and some screenshot with simple writeups to justify your designs.

## Justifications


### Justification 1(Table)

#### Good Points

1. The table headers are informative and useful to anyone who sees it. 
2. The table is visually easy to interpret.
3. The content is underlined, showing that there is important information.
4. Good use of brackets to segment the course name and course code.
5. The information is in alphabetical order, which makes it easy to understand. 
#### Bad Points

1. The primary header (Applied Sciences) is below the secondary headers. 
2. The strings and numbers are put together (for the second and third columns).
3. There are no lines separating the columns. 

### Justification 2(Pagination)

#### Good Points
1. There is previous and next, which makes it easy to navigate without tracking the page number for easy reference to a part that was just previously seen.
2. The numbers are in chronological order, making it easy to conceptualize.
3. The current page number is highlighted in black to differentiate it from other pages to give an indication that you are at that specific page number. 
4. Blue is a good color to use as people who are colorblind can look at it without any difficulties.
5. The color of the "O" in Google turns red when you are at that specific page. 

#### Bad Points
1. There's no first page and last page. This will be difficult to navigate through results that have many pages.
2. The arrows should be closer to the previous and next.
3. The numbers should be bigger in size. As when the page numbers are bigger in size, the users will not have to struggle to navigate to the page number of their choice.
4. The numbers should have more spacing. As there is a very narrow gap between the page number labels, it can be easy to click on the wrong page number as the user's mouse could be sensitive.
### Justification 3(Filtering)

### Filtering
#### Good Points
1. The search box allows you to frame it like a text and not limit you to choices.
2. The two search filters make our search more specific. 
3. There are subsections once you click the search button which helps the user in being very specific in his or her search. 
4. There is a search button which makes it easy for the user to know what to press to search for what they want to.
5. The search button is orange in color which assists colorblind users in knowing where to click to submit their request.
6. Upon typing companies in short form(e.g. KFC), it still navigates to show a fully detailed information about the company. 

#### Bad Points
1. There are multiple search bars for searching for the same thing, which may get a little confusing for the user. 
2. When the user searches for something, for the website to be easy to use, it is expected that whatever you are searching for, will appear when you are typing it halfway. But in this case, to navigate this website, the user has to type in the full text to find what they are searching for. 
3. For the "filter by status" box, it won't show any options until the "filter by entity type" box has data in it which is a disadvantage as the person may want to filter data by status only. 

### Page Size
#### Good points
1. You can type text in and use arrows to increase or decrease the number of rows the user wishes to view in a page for visual purposes. 
#### Bad points
1. The increment/decrement of the number of rows the user wants to view in a page is random which is not user friendly.
