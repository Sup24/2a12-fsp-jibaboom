# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   Supraja has created the advanced data viewer and result viewer wireframe
-   SupEr has started creating the result API
-   Supraja has created issues, milestones and labels on GitHub
-   Supraja has started creating the Result Viewer Frontend


## What do I plan to do next week

-   Clarify what we do not understand in the presentation questions.(Postpone to next week instead)
-   Fully finish backend basic result API
-   Have progress on connecting the backend to the frontend (making data come out) even if it is undefined.
-   GET Data (Advanced) in API.md
-   Complete Result Viewer Frontend(boxes wise)
-   Do getAvailabilitiesForComputation function (get it to work)
-   Fix index.js line 53 (callback is not a function) error


## Additional Thoughts

-   Very confusing but trying to survive. 
-   Better responsibility from both sides.
-   "Always one step ahead of the rest"
-   Don't run away from what you're not comfortable working with.
